Using VSCode for scripting
==========================

## Compare code **view**:
* Line numbers
* Syntax highlighting
* Adjustable layout (font size and style)

## Compare code **editing**:
* Autocomplete (`ctrl + space`)
* Automatic indentation
* Error/typo detection and highlighting
* Keyboard shortcuts (examples):
  * `cmd + /` for commenting
  * `cmd + D` for batch editing
* ~~Pasting history~~ 

## Comparing code **execution**:
* No integrated way for Praat --> in the command line

## Advanced features
* Integrated version control management (Git)
  * very handy for collaboration
* Other programming/markup languages
  * MarkDown
  * Python
  * HTML, CSS
  * and so much more (coz... extensions)

## Still missing (for Praat)
* Execution from within **VSCode**
  * Debugging
  * Proper language integration
